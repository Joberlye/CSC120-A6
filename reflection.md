- What are your initial impressions of how `Inheritance` affects your programming?
I find it very hepful and I like how it makes my work load lighter, especially when it comes to being repetitive in my code.

- What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?
I would say try reading through the read me and break it down into a few steps for the section you're working on. This way you organize your focus on each step at a time and not overwhelm yourself as you code for a bigger project.
